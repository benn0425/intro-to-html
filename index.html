            <p>Hi! My name is Matty and I am a graphic design student at Algonquin College. I'm currently in my second semester and love the program. There have been so many different classes to take and opportunities for learning new skills.</p>

            <p>I also work as a visual merchandiser at <em>Urban Planet</em>. I'm responsible for watching sales and how improving store visuals can increase sales. I implement company marketing, redo store windows, and create displays throughout the store. It can be stressful at times, but also very fun as I get to be creative through the displays I create. It's always fun to dress the mannequins and accessorize them!</p>
